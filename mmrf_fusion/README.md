# Multiple myeloma gene fusion analysis

* Data from Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) CoMMpass Study
* 742 patients (806 samples --  some patients with serial visits, bone marrow + peripheral blood)
* Gene fusion discovery and gene expression from RNA-seq
* Structural variation and copy number changes from WGS
* Mutation calls from WXS
* Clinical data including time to progression

Please see [Fuscia](github.com/ding-lab/fuscia) for single cell RNA-seq fusion detection.
